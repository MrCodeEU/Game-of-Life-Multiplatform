# Yet another Game of Life App
This is my approache at creating a Conway's game of life implementaion.
However this is a bit speciall as it usees the Kotlin Multiplatform Framework to work on mobile, Desktop and Web.

This project was originaly created for a university course and therefore is not very optimized.
